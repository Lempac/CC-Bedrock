A recreation of the Minecraft Java mod, Computer Craft for Minecraft Bedrock.

The add-on has been built around a custom programming language called Cosmic, which has been made specifically for this project.

## Important

The add-on is based on cosmic which is my first full scale language, this means you are likely to run into niche issues and bugs with the language. The language is based on a mix of rust and a C like syntax.

## Learning Cosmic

There are example programs in the GitHub Repository under the `examples` directory. Documentation for the language also exists at https://frederoxdev.github.io/CC-Bedrock/ which lists all of the built-in Structs and Enums in CC:BE

## Cosmic OS

The computers in the add-on are running `Cosmic OS` which is the shell interface used for interacting with them. To connect with a computer simply click on it, and type in chat using `>` as a prefix to run commands. Run `>help` for more information. 

## Credits

Cosmic Logo - The logo which is being used for cosmic was designed by [OuterCloudStudio](https://github.com/outercloudstudio)
